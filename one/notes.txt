1. javascript is dynamically typed

ECMAScript (often written as ES) 
is the official standard that defines how JavaScript should work.

ECMAScript = the specification (the rules)

JavaScript = the language that implements those rules

Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint,
and JavaScript as the actual house built from that blueprint.


//maths library comes by default in javascript

null is an object in JavaScript

data types : number,String,symbol,boolean,null,undefined,BigInt
derived : object,function,array


Math is a built in object for utility functions
like max ,min,safe inetger all the stuff

Math.round()
.floor()
.ceil()


// (Math.floor(Math.random()* (max-min+1)) + min) 

to geenarte a random value in the given range max to min



slice will give a part // splice it removes that part in the array

in slice the (a,b) b is excludes

in splice it is included
