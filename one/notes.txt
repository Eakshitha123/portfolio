1. javascript is dynamically typed

ECMAScript (often written as ES) 
is the official standard that defines how JavaScript should work.

ECMAScript = the specification (the rules)

JavaScript = the language that implements those rules

Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint,
and JavaScript as the actual house built from that blueprint.


//maths library comes by default in javascript

null is an object in JavaScript

data types : number,String,symbol,boolean,null,undefined,BigInt
derived : object,function,array


Math is a built in object for utility functions
like max ,min,safe inetger all the stuff
