1. javascript is dynamically typed

ECMAScript (often written as ES) 
is the official standard that defines how JavaScript should work.

ECMAScript = the specification (the rules)

JavaScript = the language that implements those rules

Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint,
 and JavaScript as the actual house built from that blueprint.
